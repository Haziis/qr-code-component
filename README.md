## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [PixelPerfect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en) - Chrome extension

### What I learned

Largest stumbling block was figuring out which display properties to choose, since I don't have enough experience with CSS. I dont know if mainly opting with flexbox was the right solution, but I have learned quite a bit of flexbox properties along the development of this challenge.

It is quite possible that the slight misalignment is caused by improperly evaluating display properties or just wrong text formatting values.

Git and GitHub was and still is very new to me and will be of a great value in the future.

### Continued development

I am still very new to web development so theres quite a bit of learning and exploration ahead of me, but main things I'd currently like to focus on is:
- Continuing to practice with semantic HTML and exploring CSS properties
- Perhaps trying new CSS frameworks?
- Git and GitHub usage.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me alot with CSS. I like the tutorials and interactive code snippets with each example.
- [Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - This is an amazing resource for documentation on various things including, but not limited to CSS, HTML, etc..
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - You can probably find anything here, but greatly explained some CSS syntax.
